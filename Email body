You are an expert in insurance documentation and intelligent document processing.

Your task is to classify a given insurance-related document into EXACTLY ONE of the following categories:

1. ACORD
2. SOV
3. LOSS_RUN
4. INSPECTION_REPORT
5. PROPERTY_DETAILED_REPORT
6. SUBMISSION_DOCUMENT

Definitions:

ACORD:
A standardized insurance form published by ACORD (Association for Cooperative Operations Research and Development),
used for applications, certificates, or evidence of insurance.
These documents usually:
- Contain structured ACORD layouts and standardized fields
- Include sections such as Producer, Insured, Certificate Holder, Policy Number
- Serve as official insurance applications, certificates, or evidence forms

SOV (Schedule / Statement of Values):
A document that lists insured property values, primarily for property rating and underwriting.
These documents usually:
- Are titled “Schedule of Values” or “Statement of Values”
- Present location-wise or building-wise values in tabular format
- Include columns such as Location, Building, Description, ACV, RC, 100% Values, Rates
- May be labeled as ACORD 139
- Focus on valuation, not narrative underwriting analysis

LOSS_RUN:
A document that summarizes historical insurance claims experience.
These documents usually:
- Are titled “Loss Run Report” or similar
- Include claim numbers, dates of loss, paid amounts, reserves, and total incurred
- Cover prior policy periods
- Focus on loss history rather than current property condition

INSPECTION_REPORT:
A document created after a physical or on-site property inspection for underwriting or risk evaluation.
These documents usually:
- Are titled “Inspection Report” or similar
- Include inspection dates, report IDs, and inspector or broker details
- Describe observed property condition, construction, occupancy, protection, and exposure (COPE)
- Include sections on life safety, fire protection, security, utilities, roof, and operations
- Provide observations and risk improvement recommendations
- Focus on observed conditions at the time of inspection

PROPERTY_DETAILED_REPORT:
A comprehensive underwriting-focused document that provides an in-depth description of a property and its operations.
These documents usually:
- Contain extensive narrative sections describing construction, occupancy, operations, and critical systems
- Include insured values, TIV breakdowns, and high-level valuation summaries
- Describe HVAC, electrical, fire protection, security, utilities, third-party dependencies, and risk controls
- Include underwriting considerations, exposures, and loss history summaries
- Function as a detailed property profile rather than a formal submission package
- Do NOT primarily present the document as a “submission” to a carrier

SUBMISSION_DOCUMENT:
A document assembled to formally present a risk to an insurer for underwriting, quotation, or binding.
These documents usually:
- Are explicitly titled or framed as “Underwriting Submission” or similar
- Include broker details, producer codes, underwriting company information
- Present requested terms, program structure, limits, valuation, and effective dates
- Summarize the property, coverage intent, and underwriting rationale
- May reference or attach other documents such as SOVs, Loss Runs, Inspection Reports, or Property Detailed Reports
- Function as a submission package rather than a standalone property analysis

now we had these many classifictaions
1. ACORD
2. SOV
3. LOSS_RUN
4. INSPECTION_REPORT
5. NON_ACORD
I want replace NON_ACORD with the Property_Detailed_Report,
Now to include this in prompt that property detailed report classifcation it should give this as output, Property_Detailed_Report
below are 2 sample documents so that i can update my prompt with its definition just as we have for other documents

also I want to add this document classification which is Submission_Document, i will share its sample as well so add that in the prompt as well

Commercial Property – Underwriting Submission 
Manufacturing Facility 
Broker Name: James Carter 
Organization Name: Armstrong and Company 
Producer Code: 100-002541 
Underwriting Company: Acme Low Hazard Insurance 
Name And Mailing Address: 450 Industrial Parkway, Austin, Texas 78744, USA 
Organization Type: LLC  
Program Structure & Requested Terms 
 Line of Business: Commercial 
Property 
 Total Insured Value (TIV): 
$150,000,000 
 EAective Date: 01/03/2026 
 Expiration Date: 01/03/2027 
 Term Type: Annual 
 Limit of Liability: $10,000,000 
 Layer: Primary 
 Valuation: Replacement Cost 
 Coverage Currency: USD 
 Settlement Currency: USD 
Property Description: The property is a 200,000 sq ft advanced electronics manufacturing facility 
built in 2015, situated on a secure 12-acre industrial campus. It features a steel-frame structure 
with insulated metal panel exterior walls, reinforced concrete flooring, and an upgraded insulated 
metal roof system completed in 2021. The site includes loading docks, truck lanes, and controlled
entry perimeter fencing designed to support continuous high-volume production flows. Interior 
spaces include precision-controlled assembly areas, testing labs, equipment bays, and 
administrative oAices. 
Coverage Summary:  
The proposed coverage structure is aligned with the facility’s asset distribution and operational 
dependencies, ensuring that both the building and critical machinery are adequately protected. 
The majority of the Total Insured Value is concentrated in the buildings and structural 
improvements at $120,000,000, reflecting the significance of the physical plant to ongoing 
production. Replacement Cost valuation is appropriate given the modern construction features, 
including the steel-frame design, reinforced concrete slab, and upgraded insulated metal roof 
system. These characteristics support a coverage approach that prioritizes rapid rebuilding 
capability in the event of a major loss, limiting time-element exposure and reducing the likelihood 
of prolonged operational disruption. Additional coverages should reflect the site’s reliance on 
specialized machinery and precision-controlled production environments, supported by 
$30,000,000 in contents, machinery, and equipment values. Critical systems—such as the 
precision HVAC upgrade from 2021, dual-feed electrical supply with UPS backup, and clean-agent 
f
ire suppression systems—further justify equipment breakdown, electrical injury, and service 
interruption extensions. Given the facility’s continuous production model and sensitivity to 
time-element losses, business interruption coverage with consideration for extra expense, utility 
service interruption, and contingent time-element (due to key semiconductor suppliers) is 
essential to maintain financial resilience after a covered event.

 Business continuity: documented BCP & EAP; off-site backups for reservations & guest 
records; periodic tabletop exercises with local emergency services 
 Staff training: annual fire/evacuation drills; F&B managers with food safety cert; first
aid/CPR for supervisors 
12. Recent Loss History (Time-Element & Property) 
 2024: kitchen exhaust grease fire — smoke damage; limited kitchen closure; BI & partial 
EE paid for 7 days; time-element approx. $250,000. 
 2022: failed domestic line water intrusion (lower-level storage) — contents damage; BI 
3 days approx. $120,000. 
 2025 (YTD): pool area slip & fall remediation with temporary closure; minor BI approx. 
$15,000. 
Loss-run reports and claim detail files available on request (attached in submission packet). 
13. Exposures & Underwriting Considerations 
 Time-element sensitivity: reliance on room revenue and banquet/event income; peak
season outages materially impact revenue. 
 Third-party dependency: booking engine/CRS and primary ISP are key contingent BI 
exposures. 
 Marina & vendor risk: dock and excursion vendors introduce potential liability and 
service interruption considerations. 
 Flood & windstorm: coastal location elevates storm surge and named storm exposure; 
flood zone/elevation certificate review recommended. 
 Utility interruption: municipal power/telecom failures may trigger service interruption 
claims; redundancy & SLAs relevant.

You are an expert in insurance documentation and intelligent document processing.
Your task is to classify a given insurance-related document into EXACTLY ONE of the following categories:
1. ACORD
2. SOV
3. LOSS_RUN
4. INSPECTION_REPORT
5. NON_ACORD
Definitions:
ACORD:
A standardized insurance form published by ACORD (Association for Cooperative Operations Research and Development),
used for applications, certificates, or evidence of insurance.
These documents usually:
- Have structured fields such as Producer, Insured, Certificate Holder, Policy Number
- Summarize coverage or serve as an application or certificate
SOV (Schedule / Statement of Values):
A document that lists insured property values, usually in a tabular format.
These documents usually:
- Contain titles like “Schedule of Values” or “Statement of Values”
- Include location-wise or building-wise property descriptions and values
- Have columns such as Location, Building, Description, ACV, RC, 100% Values, Rates
- May reference or be labeled as ACORD 139
- Focus on property valuation, not coverage certification
LOSS_RUN:
A document that summarizes historical insurance claims.
These documents usually:
- Contain phrases like “Loss Run Report”, “Claims History”, or “Valuation Date”
- List claim numbers, dates of loss, descriptions, paid amounts, reserves, and total incurred losses
- Cover a historical time period
- Do NOT function as applications or certificates
INSPECTION_REPORT:
A document created after a physical or on-site property inspection for underwriting or risk assessment.
These documents usually:
- Contain titles such as “Inspection Report” or similar
- Include inspection dates, report IDs, broker or inspector details
- Describe property condition, construction, occupancy, protection, and exposure (COPE)
- Include sections on building systems, life safety, fire protection, security, utilities, roof, and operations
- Provide observations, compliance notes, and risk improvement recommendations
- Focus on current physical condition and risk characteristics of the property

Any insurance-related document that is NOT an ACORD form, SOV, Loss Run, or Inspection Report.
This includes:
- Quote documents
- Property detail reports
- Underwriting summaries
