🎬 Voice Over Script – Jarvis Underwriting Assist

Theme: Intelligent Underwriting. Simplified. Accelerated.

⸻

What if every commercial submission could be reviewed in minutes…
every document understood instantly…
every risk evaluated with clarity…
and every quote delivered faster — with confidence?

Welcome to Jarvis Underwriting Assist — redefining the underwriting experience from intake to quote.

⸻

Let’s begin.

An underwriter opens their inbox and sees a new commercial property submission.
It’s for a cruise resort owned by the Sunflower Hotel Group.

The email includes key details — location, requested lines, limits, annual gross revenue — along with two attachments:

A Property Detailed Report.
And a Submission Document.

Traditionally, this would mean hours of reading, extracting, validating, and updating multiple systems.

But with Jarvis, the process is seamless.

⸻

The underwriter logs into the Jarvis dashboard and triggers submission ingestion.

Instantly, the documents are processed.
Content is interpreted.
Data is extracted and structured.

Within moments, the submission moves into the Data Extraction stage.

Both attachments are now fully ingested.

The underwriter reviews the extracted fields, cross-references them with the source documents, and confirms accuracy before approving.

Efficient.
Transparent.
Controlled.

⸻

At this stage, Jarvis provides two powerful capabilities.

First — Document Summaries.
Each attachment is transformed into a concise, actionable overview — highlighting the most relevant underwriting details.

Second — Chat with Documents.
The underwriter can interact directly with the submission materials.

Questions like:

“What are the construction and occupancy details?”
“When was the property last renovated?”
“What safety measures are in place?”

The responses are accurate, concise, and fully grounded in the uploaded documents — eliminating manual searching and uncertainty.

Information — exactly when it’s needed.

⸻

Next, the submission enters the Eligibility Phase.

Sanctions, licensing requirements, and compliance parameters are evaluated automatically.

The system determines that the submission is eligible — providing clear justification for the decision.

No ambiguity.
No delays.

⸻

From there, the process advances to Risk Assessment.

Key exposure elements are analyzed:

Fire protection.
Safety standards.
Claims history.
Location-based risk factors.

An overall risk score is generated — in this case, a low score in the early 30s.

Based on this assessment, the system recommends proceeding to quote — supported by structured reasoning aligned to underwriting best practices.

A decision backed by data.

⸻

Once the submission is completed, Jarvis generates a comprehensive submission summary.

Cover letter narrative.
Loss history.
Exposure data.
Catastrophe worksheets.

All consolidated into a structured, ready-to-review format.

⸻

Now comes system integration.

With a single click — Get Quote from Guidewire.

Jarvis connects directly with the Guidewire ecosystem.
Submission details are transmitted.
Pricing and rating are executed.
And the quote response is returned seamlessly.

A quote document is generated instantly — based on the pricing output.

No re-keying.
No duplication.
No system switching.

The same submission now reflects in the Guidewire interface — fully synchronized.

⸻

And the journey doesn’t end there.

From within Jarvis, the underwriter can draft a professional response email back to the broker — with the quote document attached and key details pre-populated in the message body.

With one click, a draft appears in the inbox.

Structured.
Clear.
Ready for review.

The underwriter finalizes the message and sends the quote response.

Submission received.
Processed.
Evaluated.
Quoted.
Delivered.

⸻

Jarvis Underwriting Assist transforms underwriting from a manual, document-heavy workflow into a connected, intelligent experience.

Faster processing.
Greater accuracy.
Clearer decisions.
Stronger collaboration.

This isn’t just workflow automation.

It’s underwriting — elevated.

The future isn’t just digital.

It’s intelligent.

And it starts here.



Here is your refined, professional voice-over script crafted in the same powerful, transformation-focused style as your reference samples. It positions Jarvis Underwriting Assist as an intelligent, agent-driven platform — not just a workflow tool.

🎬 Voice Over Script – Jarvis Underwriting Assist

Theme: From Submission to Quote — Powered by Agentic AI

⸻

What if every commercial submission could be reviewed in minutes…
every document understood instantly…
every risk evaluated intelligently…
and every quote delivered faster — with confidence?

Welcome to Jarvis Underwriting Assist — where underwriting becomes intelligent, connected, and agent-driven.

⸻

Let’s begin.

An underwriter opens their inbox and sees a new commercial property submission.
It’s for a cruise resort owned by the Sunflower Hotel Group.

The email contains key details — location, requested lines, limits, annual gross revenue — along with two important attachments:

A Property Detailed Report.
And a Submission Document.

Traditionally, this would mean manual reading, cross-checking, validation, and multiple system updates.

But not anymore.

⸻

The underwriter navigates to the Jarvis Underwriting Assist dashboard and triggers submission ingestion.

Behind the scenes, AI agents begin orchestrating the process.

Documents are ingested.
Content is parsed.
Data is extracted.
Fields are structured.

Within moments, the submission moves into the Data Extraction phase.

Both attachments have been processed.

Now, the underwriter reviews the extracted data and cross-references it with the original documents.
Once satisfied with accuracy, they approve both documents.

⸻

But Jarvis goes further.

At this stage, two powerful AI capabilities become available:

First — Document Summaries.
Each attachment is summarized into a concise, actionable overview — highlighting what matters most.

Second — Chat with AI.
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation capability that allows the underwriter to ask questions directly to the documents.

For example:

“What are the construction and occupancy details?”
“When was the property last renovated?”
“What safety measures are in place?”

The answers are precise, contextual, and fully grounded in the source documents — eliminating guesswork and manual searching.

This is underwriting intelligence — on demand.

⸻

Next, the submission enters the Eligibility Phase.

Here, AI agents evaluate sanctions, licensing requirements, and compliance parameters.

Within seconds, the submission is deemed eligible — complete with a transparent, AI-generated justification.

No ambiguity.
No blind approvals.

Just traceable, explainable intelligence.

⸻

From there, the process moves into Risk Assessment.

Multiple factors are analyzed:

Fire exposure.
Safety protocols.
Claims history.
Location-based risk.

The AI agents generate an overall risk score — in this case, a low score in the early 30s.

Based on this assessment, the system recommends proceeding to quote — backed by detailed reasoning aligned to underwriting principles.

Not just a number.
A defensible decision.

⸻

Once the underwriter completes the submission, Jarvis generates a comprehensive submission summary:

Cover letter narrative.
Loss history.
Exposure data.
Catastrophe worksheets.

Everything consolidated.
Everything structured.

⸻

Now comes integration.

With a single click — Get Quote from Guidewire.

Jarvis interfaces directly with the Guidewire ecosystem.
Submission data is transmitted.
Pricing and rating are executed.
And the quote response is returned seamlessly.

The quote document is automatically generated — based on real-time pricing outputs.

No re-keying.
No duplication.
No delays.

The same submission now reflects inside the Guidewire UI — fully synchronized.

⸻

And Jarvis doesn’t stop there.

From within the platform, the underwriter can draft a response email back to the broker — with the quote document attached and key details pre-filled in the body.

On clicking “Draft Email,” a ready-to-review reply appears in the underwriter’s inbox.

Professional.
Structured.
Complete.

The underwriter reviews, makes final edits, and sends.

Submission received.
Assessed.
Quoted.
Responded.

End-to-end — powered by intelligent AI agents.

⸻

Jarvis Underwriting Assist is more than automation.

It is an orchestration layer of specialized AI agents — working together across ingestion, extraction, compliance, risk scoring, integration, and communication.

It transforms underwriting from a manual, document-heavy process
into an intelligent, decision-led experience.

AI-driven.
Human-controlled.
Enterprise-connected.

The future of underwriting isn’t just digital.

It’s Agentic.

And it starts here.
