Script 2.0 sample
Meet Jennifer, our Senior CSR, as she logs into the Smart Quote Intake platform and lands on the Home Page. 
Here, she gets an overview of key metrics such as Today’s Quotes, Average Quote Time, Conversion Rate, and Revenue Today. 

As she scrolls down to the Quote Management section, Jennifer can see Ongoing Quotes, which provides a list of all active quotes, and Quote History, where detailed records of past quotes are available. 

Next, let’s move to the Quote Intake process. 
As soon as Jennifer starts handling an incoming call, then the Call Intake process kicks-in. If the caller is an existing customer, then she can view the customer’s details on the right side of the screen and corresponding fields such as Name, Email, and other customer information get pre-filled from the Policy Admin System.  

There is also a Voice Assistant, Conversational AI which listens to the discussion between Customer and the CSR Agent, and pre-fills the fields. For example, if the customer says, "Reason for my call is I want to buy a new Home Insurance", then the system automatically fills this information into the Reason for Call field. 

For new customers, the Voice Assistant can also auto-fill the entire Customer Information Form based on the conversation. 

As mentioned by the customer, Jennifer selects the type of Home Insurance policy for the quote. She enters the address which Customer provided and clicks on Analyze to view Risk, Property, and Security Details. These details are automatically populated from various integrated applications and include information such as the property’s history, built details, and security monitoring details. 

A quick quote is then generated based on the address analysis and information provided. 
The AI recommends tiers like Bronze, Silver, or Gold, along with reasoning for the recommendation, coverage suggestions, and an estimated annual premium. 

If the customer is interested in continuing after the quick quote, then Jennifer moves to the next step to capture full quote information like Occupancy details, Liability details, Content details etc.  

All questions related to Loss History, Property and Security are already pre-filled from the response of integrated applications.  

Now based on the un-answered questions and sentiment analysis of the conversation, AI-driven nudging system guides Jennifer through the rest of the questions. 
It helps Jennifer by suggesting the Next Best Question. For instance, the AI might recommend asking, "What is the Building Coverage you are looking for?"  and the Conversational AI will capture the response of the Customer. When done then Jennifer clicks on Next Question to proceed, and the form is completed based on the customer’s responses. 

The system also ensures that duplicate and redundant questions are eliminated. 
For example, if the customer selects the value of Type of Policy as "Building only" instead of "Building & Content", then capturing Content Details is not required so all questions under the Content Details sections are eliminated and grayed out. 

Once other important Questions are filled, then Jennifer proceeds to the Quote Review Screen. 

Here, Jennifer can see all the details that were captured during the process. 

In the Premium Information section, she reviews the AI-recommended tiers with the Customer. In this case, the AI suggested the Bronze coverage tier. 

In the Available Discounts section, Jennifer can apply various discounts, such as Security Discount, Existing Customer Loyalty Discount, or Full Payment Discount. The premium for each tier is recalculated based on the selected discounts. 

After discussing with the customer, Jennifer selects the Silver tier and clicks on Create Quote. The quote is then generated and is now visible in the Ongoing Quotes section under Quote Management. 

Next, Jennifer navigates to the Reporting tab, where she can view detailed analytics and reports. 
This section provides insights into Quote Performance and Trends, including Total Quotes, Average Quote Time, Conversion Rate, and Total Revenue. 

In the Overview section, Jennifer can view Monthly Performance Trends, Premium Distribution, Risk Analysis Heat Maps, and Regional Performance Analysis. 

The AI Analytics section provides additional insights, such as AI Tier Recommendations, AI Confidence Metrics, and AI Learning Progress over the month. 

The Risk Analysis section offers a detailed view of multiple risks. 
This includes a Claims Analysis Heat Map for water, storm, theft, and fire damage. 

In the Performance tab, Jennifer can view Team Performance Analytics, including Quote Time Distribution, which shows the time taken for quotes along with percentages, and Coverage Tier Distribution, which highlights the percentage of policies in each tier. There’s also a Processing Performance Heatmap for further insights. 

Finally, Jennifer explores the Revenue and Premium Trends tab, which provides a comprehensive view of Revenue and Premium Trends Analysis, Regional Policy Conversion Trends, a 6-Month Forecast Dashboard, and Growth Metrics Dashboard. 

And that’s how the Smart Quote Intake platform empowers our Senior CSR, Jennifer, to deliver seamless, efficient, and personalized customer experiences. From managing quotes to leveraging AI-driven insights, the platform simplifies complex processes, reduces key-in by the Agent, eliminates redundant questions, and ensures accuracy at every step. 

With features like Pre-filling, AI recommendations, voice assistance, nudging and sentiment analysis and advanced analytics, this platform not only enhances operational efficiency but also drives better decision-making and customer satisfaction.

Script 3.0 Sample
What if every claims KPI, every dashboard, and every insight you need was right here, in one cockpit? No more switching tabs, no more searching. Just simple, dynamic and completely transparent. 

Context 

Insurers today face a fundamental challenge - fragmented claims systems that slow processes, create inefficiencies, and erode customer satisfaction. The Claims Cockpit addresses these issues by consolidating all KPIs and OKRs into a single, intelligent platform. The items highlighted in deep blue represent active KPIs, while teams can easily select or deselect metrics to view the dashboards most relevant to their goals. Built for flexibility, it ensures clarity at every step of the claims journey. 

The Executive Summary dashboard provides an immediate view of claim volumes, pending tasks, and key metrics. Users can toggle between chart and data views and apply filters by selecting ‘Zone’, ‘line of business’, etc. The experience is clean, streamlined, and role-based, ensuring every user sees what is most important to their function. 

 Considering the Important OKR’s panel. Our claims satisfaction target is 95% - current performance stands at 97%, exceeding expectations. Average settlement time is targeted at 15 days, while the actual is 18.6, signaling an area for improvement. First-call resolution, with a 90% target, is tracked at 87%, flagged as amber. The panel color-codes outcomes to indicate which metrics are on track, behind, or at risk, providing executives with a snapshot of overall performance at a glance. 

 The Cockpit includes a dynamic dashboard powered by a prompt library. Now as per the selected zone immediate insights are generated: the Northeast reports the highest claim volume, the Midwest remains stable, and the South leads overall. Comparative analysis by month highlights patterns and emerging risks, eliminating the need for manual reporting. 

 At the management level, the system compares settlement ratios across claim managers. With a single selection, it reveals the Best performers, Highest Volume leaders, and areas requiring support - an invaluable tool for reviews and coaching. 

 Filters applied from one view are retained across others. For example, if a zone filter is applied in the Executive Summary, it remains active when navigating to Financial Performance, ensuring continuity of context. 

Metrics can be configured to match organizational priorities. For example, from the List of KPI’s and OKR’s Loss Ratio can be replaced with Combined Ratio, Expense Ratio, or Reserve Adequacy. The dashboard refreshes immediately, ensuring leadership teams monitor exactly what matters most. 

 Moving on to Turn around and Processing Time section Selecting a specific manager, such as Emily, reveals details on her team - average processing times, average settlement time, First Notice to Closure Rate and Reopened Claims Processing Time. Clearing the filter collapses the view, but the data remains available for deeper exploration. This provides actionable insights at both the macro and micro level. 

The Cockpit extends across multiple dimensions, including Legal, Actuarial, Customer Experience, Recovery Efficiency, Claim Quality, Delegated Authority, and File Management KPIs. The framework is fully customizable, ensuring alignment with evolving business needs. 

The Claims Cockpit is more than a dashboard - it is a performance transformation platform. By enabling faster settlements, clear visibility, and stronger customer experiences, it empowers insurers to elevate claims management from an operational necessity to a competitive differentiator.
