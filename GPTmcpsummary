Important instructions:

- The headings and section order (SUBMISSION SUMMARY, 1–5) must remain the same.
- Inside each section, you are NOT limited to only the example fields above.
  You may include any other underwriting-relevant information that appears
  in the text (for example, broker details, program type, special hazards,
  occupancy notes, construction details, coastal exposure, etc.), placing
  those details under the most appropriate section.
- Only write lines for information that is actually present or clearly supported
  by the document text. If a particular field or detail is not present, simply
  omit that line. Do not write "N/A", "Unknown", or mention that something is missing.
- Do not invent, assume, or guess any information.
- Do not mention pages, sections, or the format of the document itself.
- The final output must be plain text in the structured format above, with
  the placeholders replaced by real values and extra underwriting details
  added where appropriate.
