you can notice that in summary it is saying billing is direct 
but in the actual json the direct is unselected rather agency is selected

the problem is that for acord data extraction we have used OCR azure doc intelligence and it is generating a json and that same json we are using for summary so in ocr i hope you know it extracts from left to right
