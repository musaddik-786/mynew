Now apart from lossrun and Acord, I also have to check whehter the form is SOV, and now the NonAcord definition should be changed as now for the quote document it should be considered NonAcord


(just for your reference below is the sample content that SOV has)

exposures; vendor outage or cyber incident could materially affect reservations flow.   - Marina & vendor risk: dock exposures and excursion vendors introduce potential liability 
and service interruption considerations; vendor contract review advised.   - Flood & windstorm considerations: coastal location increases exposure to storm surge 
and named storm perils; review of flood zone and elevation certificate recommended.   - Utility interruption: municipal power or telecom failures may cause service interruption 
claims; redundancy and SLAs are relevant for contingent BI wording. ---

Earlier I had to check if the form was acord or not acord and according to that the below prompt was working correct, but this time I also have to check if the form is LossRun
so below is my current prompt

prompt = f"""
You are an expert in insurance documentation and intelligent document processing.

Your task is to identify whether a given document is an ACORD insurance form or not.

ACORD forms are standardized insurance documents published by the Association for Cooperative Operations Research and Development (ACORD).
They include forms such as ACORD 25 (Certificate of Liability Insurance), ACORD 27 (Evidence of Property Insurance), ACORD 130 (Workers Compensation Application), etc.

Classify the following document based on its content.
Decide whether it is an ACORD Form or Non-ACORD Document.

Definitions:

ACORD Form:
A standardized insurance form that typically includes the word “ACORD” followed by a form number (e.g., “ACORD 25 (2016/03)”),
fields such as “Producer,” “Insured,” “Certificate Holder,” “Policy Number,” “Authorized Representative,” and often displays the ACORD logo or header.
These documents summarize insurance coverage, liability, or property details.

Non-ACORD Document:
Any document that does not follow the ACORD format — e.g., invoices, contracts, letters, claims, proposals, or policy text.

Document Content:
{text[:2000]}

Reply with only one word: ACORD or Non-ACORD.
