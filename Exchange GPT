Now I also have to check whehter the form is SOV


(just for your reference below is the sample content that SOV has)
STATEMENT/SCHEDULE OF VALUES ACORD 139 (1/96)



Applicable causes of loss 

Basic, Earthquake, Flood

(below it is a table just for your understanding gpt)

CLASS CODE LOC # BLDG # DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION OF PROPERTY ACV/ RC 1 SUBJECT 2 100% VALUES RATE OR LOSS COST 3 PREMIUM



1(value under LOC column)2850 S. Delaware St. San Mateo, CA 94403 (so this is udercolumn " DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION OF PROPERTY ")

35000000 ((so this is udercolumn "100% VALUES RATE" )



(and so on, like there will be more rows 2nd third along with its data)










Earlier I had to check if the form was acord or not acord and according to that the below prompt was working correct, but this time I also have to check if the form is LossRun
so below is my current prompt

prompt = f"""
You are an expert in insurance documentation and intelligent document processing.

Your task is to identify whether a given document is an ACORD insurance form or not.

ACORD forms are standardized insurance documents published by the Association for Cooperative Operations Research and Development (ACORD).
They include forms such as ACORD 25 (Certificate of Liability Insurance), ACORD 27 (Evidence of Property Insurance), ACORD 130 (Workers Compensation Application), etc.

Classify the following document based on its content.
Decide whether it is an ACORD Form or Non-ACORD Document.

Definitions:

ACORD Form:
A standardized insurance form that typically includes the word “ACORD” followed by a form number (e.g., “ACORD 25 (2016/03)”),
fields such as “Producer,” “Insured,” “Certificate Holder,” “Policy Number,” “Authorized Representative,” and often displays the ACORD logo or header.
These documents summarize insurance coverage, liability, or property details.

Non-ACORD Document:
Any document that does not follow the ACORD format — e.g., invoices, contracts, letters, claims, proposals, or policy text.

Document Content:
{text[:2000]}

Reply with only one word: ACORD or Non-ACORD.
