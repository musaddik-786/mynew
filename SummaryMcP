Definitions:

ACORD:
A standardized insurance form published by ACORD (Association for Cooperative Operations Research and Development),
used for applications, certificates, or evidence of insurance.
These documents usually:
- Contain “ACORD” followed by a form number (e.g., ACORD 25, ACORD 27, ACORD 125, ACORD 130)
- Have structured fields such as Producer, Insured, Certificate Holder, Policy Number
- Summarize coverage or serve as an application or certificate

SOV (Schedule / Statement of Values):
A document that lists insured property values, usually in a tabular format.
These documents usually:
- Contain titles like “Schedule of Values” or “Statement of Values”
- Include location-wise or building-wise property descriptions and values
- Have columns such as Location, Building, Description, ACV, RC, 100% Values, Rates
- May reference or be labeled as ACORD 139
- Focus on property valuation, not coverage certification

LOSS_RUN:
A document that summarizes historical insurance claims.
These documents usually:
- Contain phrases like “Loss Run Report”, “Claims History”, or “Valuation Date”
- List claim numbers, dates of loss, descriptions, paid amounts, reserves, and total incurred losses
- Cover a historical time period
- Focus on past loss experience rather than property condition

INSPECTION_REPORT:
A document created after a physical or on-site property inspection for underwriting or risk assessment.
These documents usually:
- Contain titles such as “Inspection Report” or similar

- Describe property condition, construction, occupancy, protection, and exposure (COPE)
- Include sections on building systems, life safety, fire protection, security, utilities, roof, and operations
- Provide observations, compliance notes, and risk improvement recommendations
- Focus on current physical condition and risk characteristics of the property

Any insurance-related document that is NOT an ACORD form, SOV, Loss Run, or Inspection Report.
This includes:
