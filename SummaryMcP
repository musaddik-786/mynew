I have changed the code (Summary handler.py) so now i want to store beautified it in excel
earlier we were checking for Summary column in the excel and if it exists then we were storing our data in that column corresponding to the reference number row correct? so now we will be doing same but the only change is now we will look for 2 columns 1) Submission summary and 2) Document summary and now as per our response that we are getting from beautified we will store it in the excel in such a way that Submission summary column will have combined summary stored and Document summary will have filename and processed summary stored from  "individualized_summary": that we are getting from the response
