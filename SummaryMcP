This is my filename format
file_name: 123ASJKDB1JKBSAF_attachment_SOV.pdf,
file_name: 123ASJKDB1JKBSAF_attachment_Loss_Run_HighTech_Solution.pdf

This is how i am extracting that filename  file_name = item.get("file_name")
but now i want to extract only the original file name which is after the _attachment_ ie (Loss_Run_HighTech_Solution.pdf, SOV.pdf, etc)

i just want to use this line of code for it file_name = item.get("file_name")
and store that filename in the same variable which is file_name

this is was the overall code that i was refferring to give this code in what i want
