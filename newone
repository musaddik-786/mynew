    "markdown": "Summary : This image displays a stylized logo for the organization or brand \"ACORD\".\n\nlogo: ACORD  \n  Visible Text :  \n    • \"ACORD\" in uppercase, italicized serif font.  \n    • Registered trademark symbol \"®\" appears at the upper right of the \"D\".  \n  Design Elements :  \n    • Two sweeping, curved lines—one above and one below the word \"ACORD\"—create a dynamic, orbit-like effect.  \n    • A thin horizontal line runs beneath the logo, separating it from the lower margin.  \n    • All elements are rendered in black on a white background.  \n  Dimensions & Placement :  \n    • Logo is horizontally centered with ample white space around it.  \n    • The horizontal line is slightly longer than the word \"ACORD\".  \n\nAnalysis :  \n  • The logo uses dynamic curves to suggest motion or connectivity, and the registered trademark symbol indicates legal protection of the brand name. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.034,t=0.027,r=0.151,b=0.069), with ID 7e9402d7-d902-4907-9064-d309e5c6ebf5 -->\n\nCOMMERCIAL INSURANCE APPLICATION  \nAPPLICANT INFORMATION SECTION <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.257,t=0.029,r=0.719,b=0.067), with ID 41156281-aca9-47f8-b147-af96f65109e8 -->\n\nDATE (MM/DD/YYYY) <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.827,t=0.036,r=0.972,b=0.068), with ID 7233c894-72c8-47a7-9a7b-548ebb36201f -->\n\nAGENCY  \nPrime Brokers Ltd.\n\nCONTACT  \nNAME: William Grey  \nPHONE (Fac.
