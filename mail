Hi Viral,

With the month of Ramadan approaching, I wanted to request approval for a temporary work‑from‑home arrangement from February 17th to March 19th, 2026.

During Ramadan, the daily routine shifts significantly, beginning the day around 3:30–4:00 AM for pre‑dawn meals and prayers. Given this altered schedule, with fasting and a one‑way commute of approximately 2 hours becomes particularly challenging and impacts overall productivity.

As discussed, working from home during this period would allow me to manage the early‑morning routine while ensuring that my performance, availability, and deliverables remain unaffected. I will remain fully accessible during regular working hours and continue to collaborate seamlessly with the team.

Thank you for your understanding and consideration.

Warm regards,
