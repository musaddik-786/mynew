What if every submission could be reviewed in minutes, every document understood instantly, every risk evaluated intelligently, and every quote delivered faster with confidence? 

Welcome to Agent-verse Underwriting Assist, where underwriting becomes intelligent, connected, and agent-driven. 

Let's begin. 

An underwriter opens their inbox and sees a new commercial property submission. 

 The submission is for a resort owned by the Sunflower Hotel Group. 

The e-mail contains key details such as location, requested lines, limits, annual gross revenue, along with two important attachments, a property detailed report, and a submission document. 

 Traditionally, this would mean manual reading, cross-checking, validation, and multiple system updates. 

But not anymore. 

The underwriter navigates to the Agent verse Underwriting Assist dashboard and triggers submission ingestion. 

Behind the scenes, 

AI agents begin orchestrating the process. 

Documents are ingested, content is parsed. 

He sees that the data extraction indicator has now changed color, showing that the stage has been processed and a review is awaited from the underwriter. 

He opens it and sees that data is extracted. 

Both attachments have been processed. 

Now, the underwriter reviews the extracted data and cross-references it with the original documents. 

Once satisfied with accuracy, he approves both the documents. 

Now, two powerful AI capabilities become available. 

First, document summaries. 

Each attachment is summarized into a concise, actionable overview highlights. 

Second chat with AI. 

a retrieval augmented generation powered capability that allows the underwriter to ask questions directly to the documents. 

For example, what are the construction and occupancy details for the property? 

When was the property last renovated? 

What safety measures are in place? 

The answers are precise, contextual, and fully grounded in the source documents eliminating guesswork and manual searching. 

Navigating to eligibility phase. 

Here, AI agents evaluate sanctions, licensing requirements, and more. 

Within seconds, the submission is deemed eligible complete with a transparent, AI-generated justification. 

No blind approvals, just explainable intelligence. 

 Now, the process moves into risk assessment. 

 Multiple factors are analyzed such as fire exposure, safety protocols, the risk calculator tool is called by the agent to generate an overall risk score. 

 In this case, the score is low 

Thirty-eight. 

 Based on this assessment, the system recommends proceeding to quote backed by detailed reasoning, not just a number, a defensible decision. 

Once the underwriter completes the submission, a comprehensive submission summary is generated, including sections on cover letter narrative, loss history, 

 and more. 

 Everything consolidated and structured, now with a single click of the Get Quote from Guidewire button, AgentFirst interfaces directly with the Guidewire ecosystem. 

  

Submission data is transmitted, pricing and rating are executed, and the quote response is returned. 

  

The quote document is also automatically generated and can be reviewed. 

The same submission now reflects inside the Guidewire. 

 From within the platform, the underwriter can draft a response e-mail back to the broker with the quote document 

 attached, and key details pre-filled in the body. 

 On clicking draft e-mail, a ready to review reply appears in the underwriter's inbox. 

 Professional, structured, complete. 

 The underwriter reviews, makes final edits, and sends the mail response back to the broker. 

 Submission received, assessed, quoted, responded. 

 End-to-end powered by intelligent AI agents.
